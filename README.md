# Basic_ETL
ETL created by doing web scrapping

The objective is to put in practice simple understanding of what a ETL pipeline would look like. 

For this project I used python version 3.11, and some libraries like: 

--requests
--numpy
--pandas
--datetime
--bs4 (beautiful soup)
--sqlite3 

The project is well commented and every step and also have a logging process. 

After a couple tries and some research in turned out great. 

Hope is useful for someone that is learning just like me. 

Any feedback is well appreciate it, thanks!!
